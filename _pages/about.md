Currently, Wojciech pursues his Ph.D. degree in joint industry-academic collaboration between SimCorp A/S â€“ largest Danish FinTech company and leading provider of investment management software solutions for the world's leading financial organizations and Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen (UCPH). The project is supported by a scholarship from Innovation Fund Denmark (Innovationsfonden), which invests in new knowledge and technology creating growth and employment in Denmark.

During the period of the project, Wojciech is employed as Senior Research Engineer in SimCorp Technology Labs, an internal strategic innovation unit focused on deriving business value from new technology and enterprise architecture research.

Wojciech holds two Master degrees in Computer Science and Engineering, among them one from Technical University of Denmark.

# Current research
In his industrial FinTech Ph.D. research project entitled "Accelerated Financial Algorithms", Wojciech utilizes high-performance computing (HPC) techniques and modern many-core architectures such as high-throughput Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to target acceleration of large financial computational workloads for risk management and pricing of financial derivative instruments. The objective is to produce new state-of-the-art software prototypes that demonstrate the potential for performance acceleration in SimCorp Dimension, the main product offered by SimCorp A/S, to increase the value of the services that are provided to large financial clients worldwide.

At Programming Languages and Thoery of Computing Section (PLTC) of Department of Computer Science (DIKU), Wojciech is currently involved in implementing high-performance applications using the Futhark programming language, a statically typed, data-parallel, and purely functional array language. This will lead to further development of the language and its compiler, as the technologies are an ongoing research project. In his work, Wojciech is investigating algorithmic optimizations, that allow for extracting more parallelism, e.g. flattening techniques for nested parallelism.
